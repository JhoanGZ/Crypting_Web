# Crypting_Web

## Description
**Crypting_Web** is an educational project focused on demonstrating the manipulation of matrices in JavaScript while adhering to the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) and **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles. This project is designed to provide a simple yet clear example of cryptographic techniques using matrices.

## Features
- Matrix manipulation for educational purposes.
- Example of cryptographic encoding using basic matrix operations.
- Code designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy to understand.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup language for the project structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling the UI of the project.
- **JavaScript**: Main logic for matrix manipulation and cryptographic functions.
